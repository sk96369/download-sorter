# download-sorter
A script that I run periodically to keep my downloads folder clean. Moves files 
from a directory to another based on filetype.

TO SET UP YOUR OWN RULES FOR MOVING FILES, EDIT THE FILE "settings/settings.txt"

If the settings folder does not exist, run either the main.pyw or main.py script
once to create it.
